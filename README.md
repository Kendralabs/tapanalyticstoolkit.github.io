## TAP ATK GitHub .io Site
Site structure and content is created using: 

- GitHub for basic page editing and version control 
- Jekyll for site theme, templates, look-and-feel, and navigation *text/links* 
- Heroku for pushing the content to the GitHub Pages site at https://tapanalyticstoolkit.github.io/

>We plan to incorporate Prose.io to provide a level of WYSIWYG page editing capability (as an alternative to GitHub) and to hide much of the GitHub version control machinations.
